### Bridging Research and Practice
The implementation of evidence-based programs requires communication between researchers and practitioners. However, there is a documented research-practice gap in multiple sectors including education, health, and the environment.  In my research, I'm interested in understanding how social networks can be leveraged to improve the transfer of evidence (especially research evidence) between researchers and practitioners and how social networks can facilitate or hinder the implementation of evidence-based practices.
