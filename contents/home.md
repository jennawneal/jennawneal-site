I'm a Professor in the [Psychology Department at Michigan State University](https://psychology.msu.edu/directory/watlingneal-jennifer.html), and an editor at the journal [_Social Development_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679507). My current research focuses on social networks in educational contexts and spans the fields of developmental psychology, community psychology, sociology, and education. You can find a list of my published research at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kcD2PeYAAAAJ&hl=en) or in [my CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennawneal/jennawneal-site/main/contents/jneal_cv.pdf). When I'm not working, I enjoy hanging out with my husband & two cats, listening to [indiepop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_pop), traveling, and learning about wine.
