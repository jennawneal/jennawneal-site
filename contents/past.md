#### Cities
In 2012 I wrote [_The Connected City: How Networks are Shaping the Modern Metropolis_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415881420/), which merged the method of network science with the field of urban studies to explore issues at the micro- (individuals), meso- (infrastructure), and macro- (economics) scales.

My urban research at the micro-scale used simulation to understand the relationship between social cohesion (i.e. do people feel like they belong in their neighborhood) and spatial segregation (i.e. do different groups live in different neighborhoods). It also used surveys and meta-analysis to understand the origins of neighborhood satisfaction.

My urban research at the macro-scale was focused on world city networks, frequently in collaboration with colleagues in the [Globalization and World Cities (GaWC)](https://gawc.lboro.ac.uk/) research network. My earlist research was historical and methodological, but in later years turned to critiques of the interlocking world city network model and of network analysis of cities generally.

#### Political polarization
I have used co-sponsorship data to infer networks of political alliances and antagonisms among legislators in the US Congress, and to examine patterns of polarization over time. Some of this work was in collaboration with [Dr. Samin Aref](https://discover.research.utoronto.ca/32192-samin-aref), where we developed and tested methods for optimally partitioning signed networks to discover political coalitions.

#### Implementation
Implementation science involves studying when and how research and research evidence is used for practical purposes, for example, to help create public policy or inform decisions. Together with [Dr. Jennifer Watling Neal](https://www.jennawneal.com/), I co-directed the **Mi**chigan **S**chool **P**rogram **I**nformation (MiSPI) project, which investigated how public school educators find information through their social networks and use it to make decisions.

#### Other projects
* **Psychometric Networks** - In psychometric or psychologcial networks, the nodes are variables (e.g., beliefs, symptoms, or traits), and the edges are the statistical associations (e.g., partial correlations) among them in a sample of people. However, network analytic techniques are not designed for these type of data, and using them often yields invalid results. In collaboration with several colleagues, we reviewed and summarized the most significant of these critiques, recommending that researchers avoid analyzing psychological data using network methods: Neal, Z. P., Forbes, M. K., Neal, J. W., Brusco, M., Krueger, R., Markon, K. E., Steinley, D., Wasserman, S., and Wright, A. G. (2022).

* **Strength of Weak Ties** - One of the most influential and widely cited theories in all of social science is [Granovetter's 1973 Strength of Weak Ties](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2776392). Despite its enormous influence, this theory has received limited empirical support. In a series of analyses using both real and simulated data, I showed that this may be because the theory was derived from invalid assumptions about social networks: Not all bridges are weak ties, and sometimes strong ties can be bridges. In practice, this means that there is nothing particular special or "strong" about weak ties. Instead, what really matters is not whether a tie is weak or strong, but whether or not it is a bridge. These findings are summarized in: Neal, Zachary P. (2024). The not-so-forbidden triad: Evaluating the assumptions of the Strength of Weak Ties. _Network Science, 12_, 289-304. https://doi.org/10.1017/nws.2024.12
* **Data Sharing for Network Research** - To help incorporate the principles of open science into network research, at the request of the [International Network for Social Network Analysis (INSNA)](https://www.insna.org/), I chaired a working group tasked with developing recommendations for sharing network data and materials. The working group's final recommendations, which were endorsed by numeroud journals and professional associations, were published in: Neal, Z. P., Almquist, Z. W., Bagrow, J., Clauset, A., Diesner, J., Lazega, E., Lovato, J., Moody, J., Peixoto, T. P., Steinert-Threlkeld, Z., and Teixeira, A. S. (2024).
