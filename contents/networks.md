### Network Methods
I am interested in advancing improving methods for network data collection and analysis.   Some of this recent work has focused on systematic reviews and meta-analyses to understand the use of network methods in child and adolescent development.  Other recent work has focused on improving methods for selecting key opinion leaders in the context of practical challenges.

### Child and Adolescent Social Networks
Much of my research has focused on understanding child and adolescent social networks.  Some of this work has focused on characteristics of child and adolescent social networks as well as their development over time.  In addition,  some of this work has focused on understanding associations between children's and adolescents’ social networks and their behavior, personality, and well-being.

### Network Perception
Some of my research has focused on using cognitive social structures to examine children's and teachers' perceptions of classroom social networks.  Specifically, I have examined developmental and contextual predictors of teacher-student agreement on classroom social networks.  Additionally, I have examined the accuracy of children’s perceptions of their classroom social networks.
