### Backbone (<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-right"></i> https://www.rbackbone.net/)
When a network is weighted (e.g., the strength of friendship) or very dense (e.g., nearly everyone is friends), it can be difficult to visualize and analyze. In such cases, it can be helpful to focus on the network's _backbone_, an unweighted network that contains only the most "important" edges. My research on network backbones focuses on developing and comparing methods for identifying important edges (i.e., for extracting backbones), and on implementing these methods in the **backbone** package for **R**.
